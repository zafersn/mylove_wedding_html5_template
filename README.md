HTML5 wedding invitation website template, please refer to the original page: https://wpocean.com/html/tf/mylove-live/, This repo has been created thanks to the wpocean team's template. 

## Please note that: I am an embedded system engineer, So I have no experience with web development and related tools. I just wanted to develop quickly this webpage to surprise my gf and for fun. I have no commercial reasons for this. So during the development of this template, I learned everything from the internet, So this development may have many issues and an inappropriate development style.  I spent a week developing this, You can start quickly by downloading and deploying it into your hosting if you do not have any commercial considerations.<br>

Here is my work: https://eminezafer.love/
